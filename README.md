This is a very minimal React Starter to build small, throwaway apps while learning React.



1. Click on the "Use this Template" Button and setup your own repository.  

2. Clone your new repo to get started

3. Install the dependencies 

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start up the development server

```bash
npm start
```
