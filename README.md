# ReactJS starter with Parcel

This is a very minimal React Starter to build small, throwaway apps while learning React.

This is also set up as repository template. Read [here](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) to learn how to use it of just click on the "Use this Template" Button and setup your own repository.  

1. Clone the repository

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/myquite/react-parcel-template.git new-project
```
This will clone the project into a folder named new-project but you can use whatever name you'd like. 

2. Install the dependencies 

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start up the development server

```bash
npm start
```
